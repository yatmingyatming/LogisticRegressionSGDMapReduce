# Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/elsevierlabs/logistic-regression-sgd-mapreduce.git
    $ cd logistic-regression-sgd-mapreduce
    $ chmod +x *.py

# Objects
The scripts use JSON objects to represent instances, models, confusion matrices and predictions. These objects can have additional keys associated with them beyond the ones specified below; for example, each instance can have a key/value pair providing an identifier, contain key/value pairs with additional provenance information, etc.

## Instances
    <instance>           ::= <labeled-instance> | <unlabeled-instance>
    <labeled-instance>   ::= { "date_created": <iso-date>, "random_key": <value>, "class": <class>, "features": <features> }
    <unlabeled-instance> ::= { "date_created": <iso-date>, "random_key": <value>, "features": <features> }
    <iso-date>           ::= a JSON string that is an ISO 8601 datetime with Zulu (GMT) time zone
    <value>              ::= a JSON float in the interval [0.0, 1.0]   
    <class>              ::= 0 | 1
    <features>           ::= { <fv-pair>, … <fv-pair>, <fv-pair> }
    <fv-pair>            ::= <feature>: <value>
    <feature>            ::= a JSON string

## Models
    <model>              ::= { "id": <uuid>, "models": <float>, date_created": <iso-date>, "mu": <float>, "eta": <float>, "T": <positive-integer>, "parameters": <parameters> }
    <uuid>               ::= a JSON string that is a UUID
    <float>              ::= a JSON float
    <positive-integer>   ::= a JSON int in the interval [1, inf)
    <parameters>         ::= { <parameter>, … <parameter>, <parameter> }
    <parameter>          ::= <feature>: <weight>
    <weight>             ::= a JSON float in the interval (-inf, inf)

## Confusion matrices
    <confusion-matrix>   ::= { "TP": <count>, "FP": <count>, "FN": <count>, "TN": <count> }
    
## Predictions
    <prediction>         ::= { "model": <uuid>, "date_created": <iso-date>, "margin": <margin>, "p": <p>, "prediction": <class>, "instance": <instance> }
    <margin>             ::= a JSON float in the interval [0.0, 1.0]
    <p>                  ::= a JSON float in the interval [0.0, 1.0]    
    
# Usage
The Python scripts implement the key parts of a complete active learning workflow: train, validate/test, predict and query.

## From a UNIX shell
For small data sets, the scripts can be run from the command line. This allows the user to evaluate the use of the scripts before using them in a Hadoop streaming environment.

### Converting data in SVM<sup><i>Light</i></sup> format into labeled instances
Convert a file with data in SVM<sup><i>Light</i></sup> [[8]] format into a file containing instances. The mapper uses a randomly-generated number between 0 and 1 as a key; the file produced by the reducer is then a shuffled list of the training instances, making train/test partitioning to be a simple matter of specifying a split percentage. In the below example, we'll download and use the example data described in the section "Getting started: some Example Problems / Inductive SVM" from [[8]]. 

    $ wget http://download.joachims.org/svm_light/examples/example1.tar.gz
    $ gunzip -c example1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    $ cat example1/train.dat | ./parse_svmlight_mapper.py  | sort | ./parse_svmlight_reducer.py > train.data
    $ cat example1/test.dat | ./parse_svmlight_mapper.py  | sort | ./parse_svmlight_reducer.py > test.data

### Training a model
Generate a model by running a single pass of the learning algorithm over a training set of labeled instances. 

Three hyperparameters (MU, ETA and T) can be optionally set using environment variables. The SPLIT environment variable determines the train/test split; only those labeled instances with random_key greater than or equal to SPLIT are used to update the model parameters. The N_MODELS_KEY environment variable provides a unique key that will be used to compute the total number of models trained; take care to specify a key that cannot occur as a feature of any instance in the training set. When used from the command line this key will simply be assigned the value 1.0 by the mapper, as only one model will be trained corresponding to the single mapper process; when used with Hadoop streaming (as described below in the section "Using Elastic MapReduce") after the reduce tasks are executed, the value will be equal to the total number of mapper tasks executed, each of which trains a model whose weights will be averaged to generate the final output model. The mapper produces the feature string as the key with the trained weight; the reducer sums the weights associated with each key to generate the final set of key/value pairs as a tab-separated value (TSV) file. Unlabeled instances are not processed. model_encoder.py iterates through the output of the reduce step to generate a model JSON object, which can be written to a file.

    $ export MU=0.002 # a hyperparameter to control how much weight to give to the regularization penalty term
    $ export ETA=0.5 # a hyperparameter to control the learning rate
    $ export T=10 # a hyperparameter specifying the number of epochs (iterations over the training set) to perform
    $ export SPLIT=0.3 # the fraction of the total set of labelled instances sampled for testing (this setting yields a 70/30 train/test split)
    $ export N_MODELS_KEY=MODELS # the key used to accumulate the total number of models created by mapper tasks
    $ cat train.data | ./train_mapper.py | sort | ./train_reducer.py | ./model_encoder.py > /path/to/your/model

### Validating and testing a model
Generate a confusion matrix, computed by running a model against a test set of labeled instances. 

The location of the model is passed as an environment variable whose value is a valid URL. 

Validation is performed against a training set generated as shown above in the section "Converting data in SVM<sup><i>Light</i></sup> format into labeled instances". A model produced as shown above in the section "Training a model" is passed to the mapper through the MODEL environment variable. Labeled instances with random_key less than SPLIT are used to generate predictions. Unlabeled instances are not processed. The output of test_reducer.py is a file containing a confusion matrix JSON object that summarizes the performance of the model against the held-out validation set.

    $ export MODEL=file:///path/to/your/model # in this example we're loading from a file on the local system; note that this is expressed as a file: URL
    $ export SPLIT=0.3 # the fraction of the total set of labelled instances sampled for testing
    $ cat train.data | ./validate_mapper.py | sort | ./test_reducer.py > validation
    
Additionally, a model can be tested against a separately created hold-out test set of labeled instances using the test_map.py mapper. All of the labelled instances in the test set will be used to generate predictions.
    
    $ export MODEL=file:///path/to/your/model # in this example we're loading from a file on the local system; note that this is expressed as a file URL
    $ export SPLIT=0.3 # the fraction of the total set of labelled instances sampled for testing
    $ cat test.data | ./test_mapper.py | sort | ./test_reducer.py > test
    
The utility script display_stats.py can be used to process the resulting confusion matrix JSON object in the files produced by test_reducer.py to display a summary of the test run with accuracy, recall, precision and F1 metrics:

    $ cat validation | ./display_stats.py
    $ cat test | ./display_stats.py
    
### Predicting classes for a set of instances
Generate a file containing prediction for each instance in an input set of instances.

Each prediction is represented as a JSON object with the following keys:

1. model: the UUID of the model used to generate the predictions
2. date_created: the date and time that the predictions were made
2. p: the estimated probability of class membership (i.e., p(y=1|x))
2. margin: a measure of the certainty of the prediction, calculated as abs(p(y=1|x) - p(y=0|x))
3. prediction: the prediction of class membership (0 or 1)
4. instance: the JSON representation of the instance
 
The output file is intended to support active learning workflows; smaller margin implies greater uncertainty given the model, so given the output is sorted in increasing order of margin, the first line in the file can be used as the most informative instance to provide to a subject matter expert for review to determine the correct class of the instance. Additionally, instances over a threshold margin can be automatically labled with the predicted class and added to a training set to refine the model. Note that in the example below we use the test.data training set as an example; though those examples are labeled the labeling is ignored by the mapper, and alternatively a file containing unlabeled instances as defined above can be supplied.

    $ export MODEL=file:///path/to/your/model
    $ cat test.data | ./predict_mapper.py | sort | ./predict_reducer.py > predictions
    
### Generating queries to pass to a human oracle
Generate a file that is a sampled set of instance predictions to pass to a (human) oracle for labeling.

Given a file generated as in the previous section, we use a priority queue to randomly sample a set of predictions, emitting them with the uncertainty margin as the key. The reducer then emits the top k in decreasing order of uncertainty margin.

    $ export K=30 # the number of queries to be sampled for labeling by an oracle
	$ cat predictions | ./query_mapper.py | sort | ./query_reducer.py > queries
    
## Using Elastic MapReduce (EMR)
For large-scale data sets, the scripts can be run using Hadoop streaming in Elastic MapReduce. First, install the AWS Ruby libraries for running EMR command from the shell. Then upload the Python scripts and data files to a bucket in S3. For each of the above steps, one supplies the appropriate links to the mapper and reducer scripts (as an "s3n" type URI,) provide the input and output files/buckets, and set environment variables as appropriate using the --cmdenv argument. For example the EMR command that parallels the example in the section "Training a model" above would be:

    $ ./elastic-mapreduce --create --stream \
		--input s3n://path/to/your/bucket/train.data \
		--mapper s3n://path/to/your/bucket/train_mapper.py \
		--reducer s3n://path/to/your/bucket/train_reducer.py \
		--output s3n://path/to/your/bucket \
		--cmdenv N=2000,N_MODELS_KEY=MODELS
		
The result of running this EMR command would be one or more files in TSV (tab-separated value) format, one for each of the reducer jobs that were run. Each line of those files will contain a key/value pair, the name of a feature and the sum of the weights across the models trained independently in each of the mapper tasks. If more than one reducer task is executed, there will be more than one file in the output bucket containing the key/value pairs used to encode the model as a JSON object; if so, concatentate them and pipe the output through model_encoder.py to generate the model JSON file, as for example:

    $ cat part-* | ./model_encoder.py > model

The resulting model file can then be used for testing, prediction, etc. For example, the EMR command that parallels the test example in the section "Validating and testing a model" above would be:

    $ ./elastic-mapreduce --create --stream \
		--input s3n://path/to/your/bucket/test.data \
		--mapper s3n://path/to/your/bucket/test_mapper.py \
		--reducer s3n://path/to/your/bucket/test_reducer.py \
		--output s3n://path/to/your/bucket/test \
		--cmdenv MODEL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/your/bucket/model

As described above for training using EMR, multiple reduce tasks will yield multiple output files, each containing a confusion matrix JSON object, in the specified output bucket; these can be simply concatenated together and piped through the merge_confusion_matrices.py script to yield a single confusion matrix, as for example:

    $ cat part-* | ./merge_confusion_matrices.py > test
